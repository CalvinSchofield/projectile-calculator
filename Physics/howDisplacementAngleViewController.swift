       timeLAbel.text = "1: Find Time\n\t\tThe first step, regardless of the information your given, is to find time. These types of questions are particularly hard to solve, becuase it takes lots of steps to eventually cancel out variables. Essentially, you solve for time just to solve for the initial velocity so that you can find time in the end. I'll save you a headache and not try to explain this complexity, but understand that multiple steps are needed to solve for time which will only give you initial velocity which you can then find time, and everything else.\n\nBelow is an example worked out finding time, once time is found, the problem is easy to solve."
